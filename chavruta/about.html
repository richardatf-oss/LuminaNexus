      <h1>What is LuminaNexus?</h1>

      <p>
        LuminaNexus is a small, hand-built sanctuary on the web.
        It exists for Torah, honest questions, and careful creative work.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a platform for speed, hot takes, or constant noise.
        It is a place to slow down, to study with intention,
        and to build things that carry light rather than attention.
      </p>

      <h2>Three intertwined paths</h2>

      <p>
        LuminaNexus grows along three connected paths.
        Each supports the others.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Sanctuary</strong> —
          a quiet space for reflection, prayer, and presence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Study</strong> —
          learning Torah slowly, in good company,
          with sources you can return to.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Build</strong> —
          creative and technical work done with care,
          reverence, and responsibility.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Chavruta at the center</h2>

      <p>
        At the heart of LuminaNexus is <em>chavruta</em> —
        learning through relationship.
      </p>

      <p>
        Questions are welcomed here.
        Answers are offered gently.
        The goal is not to win an argument,
        but to clarify life.
      </p>

      <p>
        ChavrutaGPT is designed to support this spirit:
        answering slowly, pointing to sources,
        and inviting one small practice rather than overwhelming conclusions.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Who this is for</h2>

      <p>
        LuminaNexus is for people who want to learn without rushing,
        build without burning out,
        and engage Torah without pretending to have everything figured out.
      </p>

      <p>
        You do not need credentials here.
        You only need honesty, patience, and care.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>An invitation</h2>

      <p>
        Bring one question.
        Sit at the table.
        Study in good company.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you leave with a little more clarity,
        a source to return to,
        or one small practice to carry into the week,
        then LuminaNexus has done its work.
