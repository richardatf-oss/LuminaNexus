        <h2>What This Place Is</h2>
        <p>
          LuminaNexus is a Torah-first learning sanctuary.
          It exists to support careful study, ethical clarity, and responsible curiosity—
          especially for Noahide seekers and thoughtful learners.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site favors restraint over reach, clarity over novelty,
          and dignity over persuasion.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Stewardship</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Kiah Aviyu</strong> serves as the steward of this project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stewardship means maintaining boundaries, correcting errors,
          and keeping the tone honest and humane.
          It does <em>not</em> mean authority, charisma, or spiritual rank.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>What This Site Refuses to Be</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A source of halachic rulings or personal legal decisions</li>
          <li>A conversion platform</li>
          <li>A place for spiritual manipulation, magic, or theurgy</li>
          <li>A brand built on urgency, fear, or mystique</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If something here feels inflated, coercive, or rushed,
          it is a signal to pause and return to Torah First.

        <h2>Corrections &amp; Integrity</h2>
        <p>
          Errors happen. When they are found, they are corrected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sources are treated with respect.
          Speculation is labeled.
          Disagreement is handled with dignity.
        </p>

        <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
        <p>
          Many people seek God sincerely and are overwhelmed by noise,
          pressure, or spiritual over-claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          This sanctuary exists to offer a quieter alternative:
          study that steadies rather than excites,
          learning that leads to responsibility,
          and paths that can be walked slowly.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>
          If you find an error, have a respectful question,
          or wish to suggest a correction,
          contact will be provided here in time.
