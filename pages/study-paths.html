          Not everything at once. Just the next right step.
          These paths offer structure without pressure, depth without overwhelm.
        </p>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>How These Paths Work</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Choose one path.</strong> Stay with it for a season.</li>
          <li><strong>Short sessions.</strong> 15–30 minutes is enough.</li>
          <li><strong>Peshat first.</strong> Plain meaning before expansion.</li>
          <li><strong>No race.</strong> Readiness matters more than speed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You are not meant to master everything—only to walk faithfully
          where you are.
        </p>

          <li>Practice: speak aloud; trace patterns; keep it concrete</li>

        </ul>
        <p>

          certainty decreases.

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Path E — Physics &amp; Order (Analogy Only)</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Who this is for:</strong> Curious thinkers who enjoy analogy,
          structure, and wonder—without synthesis claims.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Focus: metaphor, resonance, order in creation</li>
          <li>Practice: keep Torah primary; label speculation clearly</li>
          <li>Boundary: Torah does not need scientific validation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>You’re ready to continue when:</strong> awe deepens but Torah
          remains the anchor.

          Choose the path that helps you become more honest, more patient,
          and more responsible.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a path stirs anxiety, pride, or urgency—pause.
          Return to Torah First.
