        <h1>The Seven Laws</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          A Torah-first overview of <em>Sheva Mitzvot Bnei Noach</em>—plain meaning, one steady frame,
          and practical examples. No coercion. No conversion engine. No halachic rulings.

        <h2>How to Use This Page</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Peshat first:</strong> we start with the straightforward meaning.</li>
          <li><strong>Practice-oriented:</strong> each law includes concrete examples.</li>
          <li><strong>Clear boundaries:</strong> this is not psak; for detailed cases, consult qualified guidance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The goal is not to overwhelm—only to help you walk with integrity: toward God, toward people,
          and toward the world.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>1) Do Not Practice Idolatry</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Plain meaning:</strong> Do not worship created things as gods. Do not give divine status to
          beings, forces, images, or systems.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Examples:</strong> refusing to bow to an idol; not offering worship as a spiritual “hack;” not treating power, fame, or money as ultimate.</li>
          <li><strong>Practice:</strong> direct gratitude and prayer to the One God; keep spiritual life free of manipulation.</li>
          <li><strong>Boundary:</strong> definitions can get technical—here we keep the principle simple: worship belongs to God alone.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>2) Do Not Curse / Blaspheme the Divine Name</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Plain meaning:</strong> Do not degrade the Name of God. Speak about God with reverence, not contempt.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Examples:</strong> avoiding profanity aimed at God; not using God-talk to shame or control others; not making vows you won’t keep.</li>
          <li><strong>Practice:</strong> choose careful speech; let your “God language” be honest, restrained, and kind.</li>
          <li><strong>Boundary:</strong> this page doesn’t police phrasing—its point is reverence and responsibility.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>3) Do Not Murder</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Examples:</strong> rejecting violence and dehumanization; refusing cruelty; refusing “righteous” harm.</li>
          <li><strong>Practice:</strong> choose life in speech and action; reduce harm; pursue peace and repair.</li>
          <li><strong>Boundary:</strong> complex legal/ethical edge cases require competent authority—this page is foundational, not a court.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>4) Do Not Commit Sexual Immorality</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Examples:</strong> refusing coercion and exploitation; honoring marriage commitments; avoiding pornography-driven harm and dehumanization.</li>
          <li><strong>Practice:</strong> treat people as people, not appetite; cultivate boundaries; repair harm where you’ve caused it.</li>
          <li><strong>Boundary:</strong> detailed categories belong to halachic discussion—here we hold the ethical center: dignity, consent, and responsibility.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>5) Do Not Steal</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Examples:</strong> no theft; no fraud; no cheating; no wage theft; no “borrowed forever.”</li>
          <li><strong>Practice:</strong> make things right; pay what you owe; be transparent; build a reputation for fairness.</li>
          <li><strong>Boundary:</strong> this is not legal advice—use it as a moral compass, and seek professional guidance for disputes.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>6) Do Not Eat Flesh Taken from a Living Animal</h2>

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Examples:</strong> rejecting cruelty for entertainment; supporting humane treatment; avoiding needless harm.</li>
          <li><strong>Practice:</strong> cultivate compassion; be mindful of where your food comes from; choose mercy where you can.</li>
          <li><strong>Boundary:</strong> this is not a full dietary system—just the foundational prohibition and its moral direction.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>7) Establish Courts / Pursue Justice</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Plain meaning:</strong> Build a society where justice exists—fair courts, honest law, accountability, and protection for the vulnerable.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Examples:</strong> supporting lawful order; serving honestly in civic roles; refusing corruption; standing for victims.</li>
          <li><strong>Practice:</strong> practice fair judgment in daily life; report wrongdoing appropriately; repair community trust.</li>
          <li><strong>Boundary:</strong> “justice” is bigger than arguments—this is about building institutions and habits that reduce harm.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>A Simple Daily Rhythm</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Morning:</strong> one sentence of gratitude to God.</li>
          <li><strong>Day:</strong> one act of honesty (even when inconvenient).</li>
          <li><strong>Evening:</strong> one small repair—apology, repayment, restraint, or kindness.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Consistency is more powerful than intensity.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Chavruta Questions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Which of the seven feels easiest for you—and which feels most challenging right now?</li>
          <li>Where do you see “idolatry-by-substitution” in modern life (power, status, ideology)?</li>
          <li>What would “establishing justice” look like in your immediate circle (home, work, community)?</li>
        </ul>
