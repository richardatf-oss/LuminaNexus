  This page is our constitution: Torah before speculation, dignity before debate, clarity before content.
</p>

      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Preamble</h2>
        <p>
          Torah precedes power.<br />
          Wisdom precedes speculation.<br />
          Character precedes knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          LuminaNexus exists to honor that order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before systems, before interpretations, before innovation or imagination,
          there is <strong>Torah</strong>—received, preserved, studied, and lived with reverence.
          This site is built on that foundation and will not depart from it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>What “Torah First” Means Here</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Torah First</strong> means that all learning offered in this sanctuary begins
          from the received teachings of Israel, approached with humility, care, and responsibility.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We begin with <strong>peshat</strong> (plain meaning) before commentary or abstraction.</li>
          <li>We respect <strong>tradition before novelty</strong>.</li>
          <li>We treat learning as <strong>service</strong>, not performance.</li>
          <li>We acknowledge limits—of knowledge, authority, and language.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Torah is not raw material for personal power. It is a discipline that forms the soul.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Who This Sanctuary Is For</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Noahide seekers</strong> seeking clarity, sincerity, and grounded study.</li>
          <li><strong>Students of Torah</strong> who value careful reading and honest boundaries.</li>
          <li><strong>Learners of Hebrew</strong> who wish to encounter the language with reverence.</li>
          <li><strong>Readers and thinkers</strong> drawn to order, meaning, and responsibility.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No prior identity is required—only good faith, patience, and respect.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>What This Sanctuary Is Not</h2>
        <p>To protect Torah, we name our limits clearly.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Not a commercial enterprise.</li>
          <li>Not a conversion platform.</li>
          <li>Not a place for halachic rulings or personal legal decisions.</li>
          <li>Not a place for theurgical, magical, or manipulative practices.</li>
          <li>Not a substitute for a living teacher, rabbi, or community.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not issue psak. We do not claim authority we do not hold.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>On Sources and Integrity</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Source-aware</strong> learning whenever possible.</li>
          <li>Clear separation between <strong>text</strong>, <strong>commentary</strong>, and <strong>interpretation</strong>.</li>
          <li>A posture that is <strong>correctable</strong> when errors are found.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where classical sources are referenced, they are treated with respect.
          Where modern language is used, it is used cautiously.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Truth is approached—not possessed.</strong></p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>On Chavruta and Study</h2>
        <p>Learning is strongest when it is dialogical.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clarify the text before expanding it.</li>
          <li>Offer one classical voice, not a flood.</li>
          <li>Return questions to the learner, not conclusions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Study here aims to awaken responsibility, not dependence.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>On Science, Philosophy, and “Physics &amp; Order”</h2>
        <p>Exploration beyond Torah is permitted only when it remains:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Subordinate to Torah.</li>
          <li>Clearly labeled as metaphor, analogy, or speculation.</li>
          <li>Free of grand claims or false synthesis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Torah does not require validation from physics. Physics does not replace Torah.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Order matters.</strong></p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>On Gifts and Offerings</h2>
        <p>All materials offered here are given freely:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Without manipulation.</li>
          <li>Without pressure.</li>
          <li>Without transaction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If something is offered, it is offered quietly, as a gift.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>A Closing Word</h2>
        <p>Torah First is a restraint before it is a declaration.</p>
        <p>
          It is the choice to slow down—to listen before speaking, to learn before teaching,
          to stand in awe before drawing conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you walk here, walk gently.<br />
          If you study here, study honestly.<br />
          If you disagree, do so with dignity.
        </p>
        <p>
          May this place serve learning that leads to life.
